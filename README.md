# ðŸ§  Task Manager CLI (with Algorithms & Data Persistence)

A modular Command Line Interface (CLI) application for managing **epics** and **subtasks**, built in Python using key computer science algorithms. It uses:

- ðŸ§® **Merge Sort** â€“ for sorting tasks by priority or deadline
- ðŸ§  **Greedy Scheduling** â€“ for ordering epics by earliest deadline
- ðŸ“Š **Dynamic Programming (Weighted Job Scheduling)** â€“ for optimized task planning
- ðŸ—‚ **Hash Tables with Collision Handling** â€“ for storing subtasks under their epics
- ðŸ’¾ **Persistent JSON Storage** â€“ retains your tasks even after program exits

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Create & manage epics
- âœ… Add, list, and delete subtasks under epics
- âœ… Automatically treat an epic as a default subtask (until replaced)
- âœ… Autosave after every action
- âœ… Intelligent input validation
- âœ… Optimized global subtask scheduling using dynamic programming
